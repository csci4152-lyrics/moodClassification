Don't want anyone to know 
Who I really am so they'll never see 
All the things I hide behind these precious walls 
I built just for me 
So if they look into the windows of my soul 
All they're gonna see 
Are my eyes starin' back 
And not shattered glass or the broken side of me 

'Cause I'm so afraid to show my darkest secrets 
I keep them wrapped in chains 
And locked up in a place where no one goes 
But I'm sure my insecurities will give it all away 
I'm heading fast straight for a crash and burn 
For me there is no shame 

(I'm going down) Back in a hole again 
(Deep under ground) Back in a hole again 
(Where no one's around) And I don't need a friend 
(So safe and sound) Back in a hole again 

I'm finally back of course behind the mask 
I've always worn for you 
To distract you, since I couldn't face the fact 
That someone ever knew 
That all I am is just some smoke and mirrors 
And a gun pointin' back at you 
And you to catch me in the act of this 
I know it would be through 

All these years I've lived in fear, that you would find out 
Just exactly what I'm made of 
Or what I'm really all about 
And it would kill me just to see you 
Point your finger and hear you say 
"You're one of them" and this I could not stand 
So I'll be on my way 

(I'm going down) Back in a hole again 
(Deep under ground) Back in a hole again 
(Where no one's around) And I don't need a friend 
(So safe and sound) Back in a hole again 

(I'm going down) Back in the hole again 
(Deep under ground) I'm in the hole again 
(Where no one's around) And I don't need a friend 
(So safe and sound) Back in the hole again 
Back in the hole again
