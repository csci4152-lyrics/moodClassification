The devil that you know
Is better than the one you don't, and so it goes

Like lonely ghosts, at a roadside cross
We stay because we don't know where else to go

The places, our old haunts
Will miss us when we're gone
We can never move on

So like lonely ghosts, at a roadside cross
We stay

The devil that you know
Is better than the one you don't

Like lonely ghosts, at a roadside cross
We stay because we don't know where else to go
We stay because we don't know where else to go
