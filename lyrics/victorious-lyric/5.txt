You got the touch, you got the power

After all is said and done, you've never walked
You've never run, you're a winner
You got the moves, you know the streets
Break the rules, take the heat, you're nobody's fool

You're at your best when when the goin' gets rough
You've been put to the test but it's never enough

You got the touch, you got the power
When all hell's breakin' loose
You'll be riding the eye of the storm

You got the heart, you got the motion
You know that when things get too tough
You got the touch

You never bend, you never break, you seem to know
Just what it takes, you're a fighter, it's in the blood
It's in the will, it's in the mighty hands of steel
When you're standin' your ground

And you never get hit when your back's to the wall
Gonna fight to the end and you're takin' it all

You got the touch, you got the power
When all hell's breakin' loose
You'll be riding the eye of the storm

You got the heart, you got the motion
You know that when things get too tough
You got the touch

You're fightin' fire with fire, you know you got the touch
You're at your best when when the road gets rough
You've been put to the test, but it's never enough

You got the touch, you got the power
You got the touch, you got the power
