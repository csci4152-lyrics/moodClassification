In a church by the face
He talks about the people going under
Only child knows
(We are lost and crazy, we're lost, lost, crazy)

A man decides after seventy years
That what he goes there for
Is to unlock the door
While those around him criticize and sleep
(Lost and crazy, we're lost and crazy)

And through a fractal on that breaking wall
Oh, I see you my friend and touch your face again
Miracles will happen as we trip
(Lost and crazy, we're lost and crazy)

But we're never gonna survive unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive unless
We are a little...

Crazy are the people walking through my head
One of them got a gun to shoot the other one
And yet together they were friends at school
Get it, get it, get it, yeah!

If all were there when we first took the pill
Then maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe
Miracles will happen as we speak
(Lost and crazy, we're lost and crazy)

But we're never gonna survive unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive unless
We are a little crazy

No, we'll never survive unless we get a little bit

Crazy are the people walking through my head
One of them got a gun to shoot the other one
And yet together they were friends at school
Get it, get it, no, no
Take it, take it, no, no

In a sky full of people only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy (crazy), crazy (crazy)?
In a world full of people only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy (crazy), crazy (crazy)?
In a heaven of people there's only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy (crazy), CRAZY?

["Lost and Crazy" in the background:]
But we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive unless we are a little crazy
I know we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy bit
No we're never gonna survive unless we go a little crazy

Always dismissed, never been kissed, ran for Genesis, they led to this, my religion.
Began to walk back to the car.
I never said before, "walk it off," trying never, it's said before.
we're all lost and crazy. We're lost and crazy.
We're lost, lost, crazy!!!

Just to see if anything comes back
Just to see if anything comes back
Back, back, back.
You took any fight that I had left
So look and comprehend the depth
Sinking with quickness
Reasonally dismissed
Looked over the source so hard to swallow
Within your words I wallow
When wait and wait for the reason?
When wait and wait for the reason?
Coming to treason and trying myself
Sentenced, not knowing any difference
And pretending anything can't help
Throw it all away
Just to see if anything comes back
Throw it all away
Just to see if anything comes back
Just to see if anything comes back
Just to see if anything comes back
Throw it all away
Just to see if anything comes back.


And then you see things
The size of which you've never known before
They'll break it
Someday
Only child know
Them things
The size
Of which you've never known before
Someday
