Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.
Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.

Dashing thro' the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh.
O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way.
Bells on bob-tails ring, making spirits bright,
what fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight.

A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated at my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
he got into and drifted back, and we we've got upset

Now the ground is white,
Go it while you're young!
Take the girls tonight,
And sing this sleighing song.
Just get a bobtail'd bay,
Two forty for his speed,
Then hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead.
