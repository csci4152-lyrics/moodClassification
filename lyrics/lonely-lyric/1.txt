Are you my family?
Can I stay with you a while?
Can I stop off in your bed tonight?
I could make you smile

In the morning I'll make you breakfast
In the evening I'll warm the bed
And I'll always be happy to kiss you
Promise I'll never get sad

Till the siren come calling, calling
It's driving me evil, evil
I was a heart breaker, I loved you
The same way I do
But I've got so much wickedness and sin

My name is Pearl
And I'll love you the best way I know how
My blonde curls slice through your heart
And the siren come calling
In the night, till the light

Help you dress yourself up fancy
Bathe you when you get sore
I'll be good, I think I could be all
You would want and more and more

Be proud when you dazzle the wondrous
Glitter your eyes for the town
Tell every last boy that you're my man
Try not to let you down

Till the siren come calling, calling
It's driving me evil, evil
I was a heart breaker, I loved you
The same way I do
But I've got so much wickedness and sin

My name is Pearl
And I'll love you the best way I know how
My blonde curls slice through your heart
And the stars are exploding in the night

It won't be long until you'll break
No, it won't be long until you break
It won't be long until you break
It won't be long until you break
'Cause I'm evil, 'cause I'm evil
